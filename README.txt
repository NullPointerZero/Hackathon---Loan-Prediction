This Hackathlon is a more on an Entry level, so there is no price, which is why i made this repository public. 
There is nothing to win but knowledge, and nothing to lose but dignity :)

The Hackathlon istself is about loan Prediction. We get some Data about Persons, their Gender, their postalcode, wether thei're married, and how much loan they already received. Based on that data we have to make predictions to test set. The predictions have to be uploaded, and are eveluated. 

Wish me luck :)
