### WIP ###

This is my submission for the Hackathlon by "analyticsvidhya.com"

This Hackathlon is a more on an Entry level, so there is no price, which is why i made this repository public. 
There is nothing to win but knowledge, and nothing to lose but dignity :)

The Hackathlon istself is about loan Prediction. We get some Data about Persons, their Gender, their postalcode, wether thei're married, and how much loan they already received. Based on that data we have to make predictions to test set. The predictions have to be uploaded, and are eveluated. 

Wish me luck :)


-------   U P D A T E   -------
I completed my first submission and landed on Place 9723 out of 80 000 registrated participants. The Contest isnt over, it on for the whole year, so this wont be my final placement. My Machine Learning Algorithm made Predictions about >70% right. This is a decent number for my first contribution. The final submission isnt on this Repository, but it should be easy to generate one yourself with my programm.


------    U P D A T E   -------
I made some changes and landed on Place 2311. The Prediction is about 81% correct. I think this is the furthest that my prediction model can go. The K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm is now at its limits. I was a good learning experience, and i think a Placement of 2311 is not bad at all. My next Try should be a Neural Network.
